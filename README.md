#ip-boot-service

This is a simple web service that I use for demo's to show off multi-cloud examples.  It uses a couple web services to:

1. Get the public IP address of the local system
2. Determine ISP information about that address

Basic use cases are to try to determine which cloud provider the application is running on.
